# 11. **What is React?**

- **Based on components:** Heavily reusable areas like nav, buttons, pictures, anything we see
- **Declarative:** We describe how components look like and how they work using JSX based on current data/state. React is basically abstraction from standard DOM. JSX Handles all HTML/CSS/JS
- **State-Driven**: State (Array of apartments) > Render > UI (Components in JSX) > Update State > Repeat
